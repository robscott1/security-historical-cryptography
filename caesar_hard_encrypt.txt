but this is not a claim that man should stay always youthful. supposing that that famous spaniard, landing upon florida's coral strands, had found that mythical fountain of youth; what a calamity for mankind! a world without maturity of thought; without man's full-grown muscular ability to construct mighty buildings, railroads and ships; a world without authors, doctors, savants, musicians; nothing but youth! i can think of but a solitary approval of such a condition; for such a horror as war would not,â€”could not occur; for a child is, naturally, a small bunch of sympathy. i know that boys will "scrap;" also that "spats" will occur amongst girls; but, at such a monstrosity as killings by bombing towns, sinking ships, or mass annihilation of marching troops, childhood would stand aghast. not a tiny bird would fall; nor would any form of gun nor facility for manufacturing it, insult that almost holy purity of youthful thought. anybody who knows that wracking sorrow brought upon a child by a dying puppy or cat, knows that childhood can show us that our fighting, our policy of "a tooth for a tooth," is abominably wrong.
